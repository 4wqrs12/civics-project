      <h3>What is pollution?</h3>
      <p>
        It is the introduction of harmful materials, known as pollutants, into
        nature. These pollutants can originate from different sources, most
        common being natural and man-made. Some natural pollutants is from
        volcanoes, forest fires, and dust storms. Examples of man-made
        pollutants can come from gases of motor vehicles, waste from power
        plants, and soil pollution like pesticides.

      <h3>How does it affect us?</h3>
      <p>
        Natural pollution does not harm us as much as man-made pollution, which
        can come in different forms and is constantly happening, making it
        dangerous to our planet. Air pollution, for example, can result in
        climate change, which is the change in global temperatures and weather
        patterns. Pollution can affect us too, as we can die earlier than we
        should, because of the health problems one would experience because of
        pollution. Some causes of these early deaths are from respiratory
        diseases, lung cancer, and other health issues caused by pollution.

        What are some simple things people can do to help decrease pollution?
      </h3>
      <p>
        To help decrease pollution in your community, you should aim to buying
        local goods, since it would take less emmissions to transport it to its
        destination. You should reuse items such as plastic bags or bottles for
        later uses, or completely eliminate using it and go for reuseable
        bottles and bags. Another way you could help reduce pollution in your
        community is by using non-motor forms of transportation for places that
        are close to you. Some examples could be biking to your local
        supermarket or walking to your friend's house. Or if you need to use
        motor vehicles, you should aim for public transportation or carpooling
        whenever possible. There are still so many other ways you could help be part of the solution, but these are just to list a few.

    <div id="organizations">
      <h3>What organizations can I join to further combat pollution?</h3>
      <p>There is a possibilty that there is a local cleanup group in your community, which can focus on cleaning up public places like parks or beaches. You can also help these organizations by donating money to them, so you can still have a impact on the world without having to live a finger. For example, you could <a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/donate/" target="_blank">donate</a> to The Ocean Cleanup, which is a nonprofit organization in the Netherlands that develops technology to remove plastic from oceans. But some local organizations, for example, in Massachusetts, is <a href="https://neponset.org/" target="_blank">The Neponset River Watershed Association</a> which aims to clean different parts of the Neponset River, and the surrounding lands too. There is also a organization which has partnered with many others, and it is <a href="https://www.earthday.org/" target="_blank">earthday.org</a>. This organization is more serious about their goals, and have have helped combat pollution in many different countries. </p>
